            <h2>March 22, 2024 (Bankrate: New Rules for Real Estate Commissions in the US Take Effect in July)</h2>

            <p>
                One of the hottest topics in the housing market is undoubtedly the controversy surrounding real estate commissions. This issue has gained renewed attention after the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the largest real estate lobby group in the US, agreed to pay over $400 million in a settlement related to an antitrust lawsuit.<br><br>

                NAR and some major brokerage firms have long been accused of inflating commissions through collusion. In October of last year, a federal jury recognized these allegations, prompting the defendant brokerage firms to pursue out-of-court settlements. Finally, in March of this year, NAR also raised the white flag.<br><br>

                The crux of this settlement is to overhaul the existing "seller-paid" commission practice. Currently, sellers are typically required to pay commissions not only to their own agent but also to the buyer's agent. However, this practice will be abolished under the <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong>new rules that are set to take effect in July</strong></span>. As a result, negotiations between buyers and agents regarding compensation are expected to become more active soon.<br><br>

                So, how are real estate commissions currently determined? A rate of 5-6% of the home's price is typically the norm, although there are significant variations across regions and individual transactions. This commission is usually split evenly between the seller's and buyer's agents.<br><br>

                The issue is that this commission structure, which ties the fee to the transaction size, can distort the market. For instance, agents are more inclined to offer discounts on higher-priced homes since securing a single listing can be lucrative. The same incentive is absent for lower-priced home transactions.<br><br>

                As a result, some innovative companies have recently attempted to overhaul the commission model itself. Some offer flat-fee structures, while others provide free services. However, most of these companies have yet to establish a solid market presence due to low consumer awareness and stiff competition from established players.<br><br>

                There is an option to avoid commissions altogether: For Sale By Owner (FSBO), where the homeowner handles the transaction directly. In fact, it is estimated that around 7% of all home sales in the US last year were completed without the assistance of agents. However, this method requires handling complex procedures like contract drafting and title transfers independently, which can be burdensome.<br><br>

                For those looking to accelerate the transaction process, iBuyers or cash-buying companies can be an alternative. They offer slightly lower prices than market rates in exchange for a quick sale. However, it's important to note that service fees comparable to commissions may still apply in these cases.<br><br>

                There are various options to avoid or reduce commissions based on individual circumstances and needs. Experts view the expansion of transaction choices as a positive development, as it can directly benefit consumer welfare.<br><br>

                However, some are concerned about the potential downsides of excessive market distortion. In particular, there are concerns about a potential mass exodus of current agents due to plummeting commissions, which could lead to weakened property information networks and consumer harm.<br><br>

                If commissions continue to decline at the current rapid pace, there is a risk of market functionality being impaired. In addition to self-regulation efforts within the industry to stabilize commissions, reasonable guidelines from government authorities seem necessary. Only then can consumer interests and market stability, the two rabbits, be secured simultaneously.<br><br>

                The controversy surrounding commissions is ultimately tied to the overall health of the housing market. It's time to move beyond the simple defense of agents' vested interests and explore alternatives that can create a win-win situation for all market participants. The foresight of industry leaders like NAR is more crucial than ever.<br><br>

                It remains to be seen how much this settlement will change the entrenched commission practices. Calls are growing for competition to extend beyond simple rate wars and encompass more fundamental service competition. The development of new business models leveraging digital technologies is also expected to gain momentum.<br><br>

                Ultimately, the key question in the midst of these changes will be how much consumer choice can be expanded. Only when market transparency and efficiency are balanced can we expect a qualitative leap in real estate brokerage services. Industry self-regulation efforts and prudent coordination from policymakers are more imperative than ever.<br><br>
