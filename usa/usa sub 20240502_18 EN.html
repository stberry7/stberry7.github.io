            <h2>May 6, 2020 (Harvard Magazine: The World's Costliest Health Care)</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong></strong></span>
            The United States spends the most on healthcare globally. However, despite this high spending, many Americans are unable to afford proper medical treatment due to the financial burden, negatively impacting not only individual health and quality of life but also society as a whole. Consequently, the need for reforms in the U.S. healthcare system has been repeatedly raised.<br><br>

            While there are various reasons behind the high healthcare spending in the U.S., they can be broadly summarized into three main factors. First, the increase in administrative costs due to a complex and inefficient administrative system. Administrative costs in the U.S. healthcare system account for approximately one-third of total healthcare spending, a remarkably high level. This is attributed to the existence of multiple private insurance companies and a lack of standardized administrative procedures and systems. In contrast, other countries with multiple insurers and private healthcare providers, such as Germany and Switzerland, have administrative costs that are less than half of those in the U.S. To reduce administrative costs, the government needs to establish and enforce standardized rules and systems for private insurance companies and healthcare providers.<br><br>

            Second, high healthcare costs due to market monopolies. Drug prices in the U.S. are significantly higher than in other developed countries, as pharmaceutical companies leverage their market dominance to set exorbitant prices. Prestigious hospitals have also charged several times more than regular hospitals for the same medical procedures, exploiting their brand power. The problem is that most patients have no choice but to use these expensive drugs or hospitals. Not only is it difficult for uninsured individuals to afford high drug prices, but patients with severe illnesses tend to prefer prestigious hospitals in specific situations.<br><br>

            Therefore, relying solely on market forces is unlikely to solve the issue of excessive healthcare costs, and there are growing calls for direct government intervention through measures such as drug price regulations and fee caps. However, there are concerns that excessive regulation could undermine pharmaceutical companies' incentives for investing in new drug development or reduce the quality of medical services at prestigious hospitals. As such, balanced regulation at an appropriate level seems necessary.<br><br>

            Third, the imbalanced supply and overuse of healthcare services. The U.S. has an oversupply of high-cost medical equipment like MRI and PET scanners, as well as specialists, while facing a chronic shortage of primary care and preventive services. The oversupply of expensive medical services leads to unnecessary tests and procedures, contributing significantly to rising overall healthcare costs. Questions have also been raised about the effectiveness of highly advanced medical services. While the U.S. spends substantially more on treating cardiovascular diseases and cancer, treatment outcomes are often inferior compared to other developed countries.<br><br>

            Of course, artificially limiting the supply of expensive medical equipment as a means of cost reduction is not a straightforward task. Additionally, it is crucial to incentivize healthcare providers to avoid the overuse of unnecessary medical services. Therefore, there are many suggestions to move away from the traditional fee-for-service model and instead allocate global budgets to healthcare institutions while sharing a portion of the cost savings with them as incentives. However, for such policies to be effective, they must be designed meticulously to encourage voluntary participation from healthcare institutions and manage health outcomes simultaneously.<br><br>

            Meanwhile, as the burden of healthcare premiums and medical expenses dampens economic activity for households and businesses, hindering economic growth, healthcare reform has become an urgent national priority that can no longer be postponed. However, there is a significant divide between opposing camps regarding the direction of reform. Progressive groups favor a government-led single-payer model that minimizes administrative costs and facilitates universal healthcare provision, while conservatives argue that market competition principles can improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of healthcare.<br><br>

            For healthcare reform to succeed, it must strike a balance between addressing the concerns and demands of each camp while offering bold solutions to tackle the underlying problems. Resistance from stakeholders is likely to be significant. Therefore, leadership is needed to present a vision of reducing healthcare costs and improving access to medical services, convincing all members of society that they will benefit. Additionally, complementary measures must be developed to minimize adverse effects of the reforms and protect vulnerable populations.<br><br>

            If the U.S. healthcare reform succeeds, it would be highly significant in itself, as it can improve the quality of life for individuals and enhance the overall sustainability of society. Furthermore, the U.S. experience could provide valuable insights for other developed countries facing challenges of an aging population and rising healthcare costs.<br><br>
