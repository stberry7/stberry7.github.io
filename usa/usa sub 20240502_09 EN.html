        <p>
            <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong></strong></span>
            This article, based on a March 15, 2024 report by Matthew Sherdan, highlights the 7 wealthiest cities in the United States.<br><br>

            Atherton, California: Located between San Francisco and San Jose, near Silicon Valley, Atherton has a median household income exceeding $500,000, about seven times the national average. This affluent community is home to tech giants like the Facebook CEO and NBA stars like Stephen Curry. With a population of under 8,000, the city maintains a comfortable living environment through strict zoning regulations and offers excellent accessibility to the two major cities.<br><br>

            McLean, Virginia: A suburban community of Washington D.C., McLean is an upscale residential area popular among politicians, corporate executives, and diplomats. It belongs to Virginia's top-ranked Fairfax County school district and is adjacent to the affluent Potomac, Maryland, separated by the Potomac River. Its proximity to the nation's capital contributes to average home prices well over $1 million. Major corporations like USA Today and Freddie Mac have headquarters here, contributing to the high cost of living.<br><br>

            Scarsdale, New York: Situated in Westchester County, north of Manhattan, Scarsdale is an affluent commuter town with a median income exceeding $300,000. With a population of around 18,000, it's known for beautiful architecture, excellent public schools, and has been home to celebrities like Rob Reiner and Laiza Minnelli. The surrounding forests, parks, and nature preserves contribute to its pleasant environment.<br><br>

            Los Altos Hills, California: In Santa Clara County, Northern California, Los Altos Hills is a residential-only city boasting an affluent community with no commercial districts but excellent schools. The median income is around $400,000, and home prices continue to rise. Along with nearby Atherton, it's a popular choice for high-income tech professionals commuting to San Jose and San Francisco, seeking a rural lifestyle.<br><br>

            Darien, Connecticut: One of Connecticut's wealthiest towns, Darien is a high-income city with a median income exceeding $300,000, located just 35 minutes from New York City. With average home prices over $1 million, it's a prime destination for New York commuters. It also offers excellent schools and safe neighborhoods, ideal for raising children.<br><br>

            Winnetka, Illinois: Situated along the northern Chicago coastline of Lake Michigan, Winnetka boasts an average income of $350,000 and home prices exceeding $1 million. The brick houses featured in the movie "Home Alone" are a tourist attraction here. Known for its beautiful tree-lined streets, top-rated schools, and safe neighborhoods, Winnetka is often ranked among the best places to live in the country. Its convenient commute to Chicago makes it a popular choice for affluent working families.<br><br>

            Lexington and Newton, Massachusetts: Located on the outskirts of western Boston, Lexington and Newton are among the wealthiest cities in Massachusetts. 70% of Lexington's residents earn over $100,000 annually, while the average income in Newton, with a population of 90,000, exceeds $130,000. Lexington is also a historic city known for the "shot heard round the world" that sparked the American Revolution. Both cities have a high concentration of graduates from prestigious universities like Harvard and Boston University, as well as advanced medical facilities, catering to their highly educated and affluent residents.<br><br>

            In summary, the affluent cities in the US are often located near major metropolitan areas like New York, Boston, Washington D.C., and San Francisco, while offering pleasant living environments and excellent educational facilities. Some are situated near tech hubs like Silicon Valley or financial centers. The median incomes typically range from $300,000 to $500,000, and home prices are well over $1 million, far exceeding national averages. With high education levels, strong safety, and beautiful natural surroundings, these cities provide a luxurious lifestyle. However, the exorbitant costs of living and skyrocketing home prices make them inaccessible to the average citizen.<br><br>
