            <h2>March 15, 2024 (USA Today: Real Estate Commissions Are Coming Down)</h2>
        <p>
            A seismic shift is happening in the real estate industry. With the recent settlement between the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and an antitrust lawsuit, the long-standing commission practices are expected to undergo significant changes. While this is good news for consumers, considerable turmoil and pain are anticipated within the industry.<br><br>

            The events can be traced back to 2019, when a group of home sellers filed a class-action lawsuit against NAR and major brokerage firms, alleging commission collusion in the industry and seeking compensation. The U.S. Department of Justice also echoed these concerns, criticizing NAR's practices.<br><br>

            In the U.S. housing market, it has been an unwritten rule for sellers to pay commissions not only to their own agents but also to the buyer's agents. Commissions were typically set at around 5-6% of the transaction price, with the buyer's and seller's agents splitting the fee.<br><br>

            According to this settlement, this practice will be abolished. <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong>Starting in July, buyers will directly negotiate commissions with their own agents.</strong></span> This means that sellers will no longer have to bear the double burden. On the surface, this seems to promote consumer interests.<br><br>

            However, there are also concerns that costs could be shifted onto buyers. In particular, legal expenses related to navigating complex contract procedures are expected to be considerable. There are also concerns that home purchases could become more challenging, as commissions are typically reflected in the overall transaction price.<br><br>

            Meanwhile, increased competition seems inevitable for the brokerage industry. <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong>It is projected that 60-80% of the 1.6 million current licensed real estate agents may leave the industry.</strong></span> As agents face commission competition, their profitability could be severely impacted.<br><br>

            Experts unanimously agree that this could lead to limited consumer choices. Some estimates suggest that transactions could decline by around 30% in a situation with insufficient property information. The impact on the overall housing market is expected to be significant.<br><br>

            There are also concerns about the potential downsides of a rapid overhaul of the commission structure. With an annual commission market worth $100 billion (approximately $133 trillion won) in the US, industry backlash is expected to be substantial. Conflicts and pains surrounding new commission models are likely to be significant.<br><br>

            Within the industry, there are also calls for self-regulation to improve the quality of brokerage services. Instead of simply engaging in price competition based on market demand, the focus should be on enhancing professionalism and creating added value. The emergence of various commission models, such as flat fees or performance-based fees, is also being anticipated.<br><br>

            The role of policymakers is also noteworthy. There is a consensus on the need for institutional improvements to enhance consumer benefits and market efficiency. Typical measures include establishing an evaluation system for quality control of brokerage services and expanding educational programs.<br><br>

            Technological innovation is also cited as a factor accelerating change. Next-generation brokerage services incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) or virtual reality (VR) are expected to gain momentum. Customized property recommendations based on big data analysis are also likely to become more widespread.<br><br>

            Attention is focused on the direction of the real estate brokerage market, which is undergoing a paradigm shift. There is a strong consensus on the importance of gaining consumer trust and improving market transparency. Suggestions are gaining traction that a long-term vision should be pursued instead of being mired in short-term interests.<br><br>

            There is a prevailing view that a virtuous cycle of industry self-regulation and active market management by the government will ultimately lead to the establishment of a sound market order. Efforts across society to maximize consumer utility are expected to accelerate.<br><br>

            In the midst of this whirlwind of change, the importance of communication and cooperation among stakeholders cannot be overstated. An open attitude to understand each other's challenges and perspectives is essential. It remains to be seen whether short-term pains can be endured and a path to long-term coexistence can be found.<br><br>

            It is hoped that this incident will serve as an opportunity to enhance the transparency and efficiency of the U.S. housing market. It is time for society as a whole to pool its wisdom to find a win-win solution for both consumers and the brokerage industry.<br><br>
