            <h2>January 2, 2024 (ROCKET: The 15 Most Affordable States to Buy a House in 2024)</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong></strong></span>
            We introduce the 15 most affordable states for buying a house in the US in 2024.<br><br>

            US Population: 334,914,895<br>
            Median Household Income: $75,149<br>
            Median Home Sale Price: $431,000<br><br>

            Many experts recommend using the 30% rule to determine housing affordability. Essentially, when buying a home, your monthly housing costs should not exceed 30% of your total monthly income. Anyone spending more than 30% is considered "cost-burdened." The amount one should spend each month on housing may vary from household to household, but the 30% rule provides a general idea of how affordable a particular area is by comparing the median income to the median housing cost.<br><br>

            According to the U.S. Census Bureau, American homeowners with a mortgage spend around $1,828 on housing costs each month, just below the national average household income of $75,150. Dividing the national average monthly mortgage cost by the average monthly total income shows that the national average is spending less than 30% of income on housing.<br><br>

            As the 30% rule suggests, true affordability is not just about which state has the lowest housing costs. Home prices, average incomes, and local living costs all factor into calculating a state's actual affordability.
            For example, imagine moving to an area where home prices are significantly lower than the national average but average incomes are also relatively low. While housing prices may be affordable, your income could be too low to comfortably afford one of those cheaper homes. Or you could move to an area with higher home prices, but the average income is also higher to better match the local cost of living.<br>
            Every state has affordable housing options, but if the overall cost of living is too high, it may not realistically be within a buyer's budget.
            The following are states with lower than average housing costs and where the average monthly housing cost is less than 30% of the average monthly total income. These are the most affordable states for buying a house based on the ratio of average total monthly income to housing costs in each state.<br><br>

            West Virginia: Beautiful natural scenery and great for outdoor activities, with charming small cities like Charleston.<br>
            Oklahoma: Vast prairies, historic small towns and Tulsa, as well as vibrant cities like Oklahoma City.<br>
            Louisiana: Many historic cities like New Orleans and affordable housing prices.<br>
            Mississippi: The essence of Southern culture and tradition, with cities like Jackson offering rich food and music scenes.<br>
            Kansas: Strong agricultural, manufacturing, and aerospace industries, with affordable housing and living costs.<br>
            Iowa: The top corn-producing state, with cities boasting arts, culture, and culinary offerings.<br>
            Arkansas: A blend of cities with attractions like the Ozark Mountains, hot springs, and diamond mines, as well as nature.<br>
            Illinois: Home to cultural cities like Chicago, with a relatively lower cost of living compared to other states.<br>
            Nebraska: Known for agriculture but also offering rich city cultures in Omaha and Lincoln.<br>
            Ohio: Famous for producing astronauts, with diverse city culture and natural landscapes.<br>
            Missouri: Unique food cultures like St. Louis pizza and Kansas City barbecue, as well as 85 state parks and natural beauty.<br>
            Wyoming: Stunning natural scenery like Yellowstone National Park, also suitable for retirement living.<br>
            Alabama: Southern charm along the Gulf Coast beaches, combined with an affordable cost of living.<br>
            <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong>Michigan: Offers a mix of big-city vibes in Detroit and suburbs, as well as small-town charm and abundant outdoor activities.</strong></span> Michigan is very affordable for both residents and localities. It has the big-city atmosphere and economic opportunities of Detroit and its surrounding suburbs, the eternal coolness of Ann Arbor, the vibrancy of Grand Rapids, the charm of Traverse City, and the tranquility of the Upper Peninsula. 
            Avid hikers will find refuge in the state's abundant nature, and suburban residents will appreciate the many shopping and dining options as well as nearby conveniences.<br>
            Georgia: Rich in historical sites, and economic hub cities like Atlanta offer plenty of job opportunities.<br><br>

            While all these states have below-average housing cost burdens, it's important to choose a location that suits your individual lifestyle and needs.<br><br>
