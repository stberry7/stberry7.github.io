            <h2>Fiscal Year H-1B (2025)</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong></strong></span>
            2023 Fiscal Year H-1B FAQ<br><br>

            What is a Fiscal Year H-1B?<br><br>
            The USCIS fiscal year runs from October 1st of each year to September 30th of the following year. If an employer sponsors an employee for H-1B employment, and the employee has never been in H-1B status before, a Fiscal Year H-1B approval is required.<br>

            Who is eligible for Fiscal Year H-1B benefits?<br><br>
            Generally, individuals employed in F-1, L-1 status, those working on an H-4 EAD or L-2, individuals in TN/E-3/O status but seeking permanent residency, or foreign nationals residing outside the U.S. who an employer wishes to employ are eligible.<br><br>

            How many H-1B visas are available?<br>
            Under current law, USCIS can approve up to 65,000 regular H-1B visas and 20,000 H-1B visas for individuals with a U.S. master's degree or higher each fiscal year. However, H-1B visas for employment with non-profit research organizations, government agencies, and educational institutions are exempt from the cap.<br><br>

            What is the petition timeline and selection process?<br>
            USCIS accepts H-1B petitions annually starting in April for the upcoming six-month period. Since 2020, a pre-registration system with random selection has been used, and if selected, the H-1B petition must be filed within 90 days of the selection notification.<br><br>

            What are the H-1B selection odds and related statistics?<br>
            The selection odds vary based on the total number of registrants, with U.S. master's degree holders having a relative advantage. In 2024, 188,400 cases were selected out of 780,884 registrations, while <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong>in 2025, 120,603 cases were selected out of 479,953 registrations</strong></span>.<br><br>

            Is employment authorized while the H-1B petition is pending?<br>
            Generally, no, but if an F-1 OPT expires after April 1st, the Cap-Gap provision extends it until October 1st. However, if the H-1B petition is denied or not selected, employment must cease immediately.<br><br>

            Can international travel occur while the H-1B petition is pending?<br>
            This can be risky for all employees and should be approached with caution. Even for Cap-Gap applicants, travel is only possible with a valid F-1 visa after H-1B approval. If a change of status petition is pending, departure may be deemed abandonment. Consulting an attorney is advisable based on individual circumstances.<br><br>

            What is the difference between a consular-processed H-1B and a change of status H-1B?<br>
            With a consular-processed H-1B, the individual must obtain a visa stamp after approval to enter the U.S. and begin employment. With a change of status H-1B, the individual can continue working in their current status.<br><br>

            When can the H-1B visa stamp be applied for?<br>
            The H-1B visa stamp can typically be applied for up to 30 days before the H-1B start date, and entry into the U.S. is permitted up to 10 days before the start date. However, it's important to note that due to COVID-19, most U.S. consulates currently have limited visa services.<br><br>

            What should employers and employees be aware of?<br>
            Providing accurate information is essential during registration and H-1B petition filing.<br>
            Even after approval, H-1B petitions may be subject to eligibility reviews.<br>
            Requests for Evidence (RFEs) must be addressed thoroughly, which can cause processing delays.<br>
            Changes in employers or employment terms require special attention under H-1B status.<br>
            Employers must comply with obligations like fee payments, wage maintenance, and written termination notices.<br>
            Failure to depart the U.S. after H-1B expiration can lead to unlawful presence.<br><br>

            Monitoring evolving policies and procedures, and seeking expert assistance, is crucial for navigating the Fiscal Year H-1B program. By staying informed about updated USCIS regulations and immigration trends, and making every effort to ensure successful H-1B acquisition, both employers and employees can successfully navigate this process.<br><br>
