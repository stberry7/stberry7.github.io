            <h2>January 31, 2023 (CNN: US Health Spending Highest Among Wealthy Nations but Has Worst Life Expectancy)</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="color: #2205c9;"><strong></strong></span>
            A study has found that while the United States spends the most on healthcare among high-income nations, it has the lowest life expectancy and the highest rates of chronic diseases. According to a recent report from The Commonwealth Fund, an independent research organization based in New York, the U.S. also ranks highest in mortality rates from preventable or treatable causes and maternal and infant mortality rates.<br><br>

            Munira Gunja, the report's lead author and a senior researcher, stated, "Americans live shorter and sicker lives because the U.S. healthcare system is not up to the task." She emphasized, "To catch up with other high-income countries, the U.S. needs to expand access to care, aggressively control costs, and invest in social services that contribute to better health and equity."<br><br>

            Americans tend to visit doctors less frequently than people in other countries, which may be related to the fact that the U.S. has a below-average number of physicians. Additionally, the U.S. is the only country among those surveyed that does not have universal healthcare coverage. In 2021, 8.6% of the U.S. population was uninsured.<br><br>

            The Commonwealth Fund researchers noted, "The U.S. not only lacks universal coverage but also seems to have a healthcare system that is designed to deter people from using it." They added, "The primary reason people remain uninsured is still affordability, and nearly half of working-age adults report delaying or going without needed care because of high out-of-pocket costs."<br><br>

            In December, the researchers collected health statistics from 38 high-income countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). They then compared these countries' performances with the U.S.<br><br>

            The results showed that in 2021 alone, U.S. per capita national health expenditure was nearly double the OECD average and three to four times higher than countries like Korea, New Zealand, and Japan. Globally, healthcare spending has been increasing steadily since the 1980s, primarily due to advancements in medical technology, rising healthcare costs, and increased demand for healthcare services.<br><br>

            Furthermore, the U.S. had the highest proportion of the population with multiple chronic conditions and the highest obesity rate among the countries compared. As of 2020, the U.S. life expectancy at birth was 77 years, three years shorter than the OECD average, and it is estimated to have dropped further in 2021. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. had more COVID-19 deaths than any other high-income country.<br><br>

            The U.S. also had significantly higher mortality rates from assaults, including firearm violence. In 2020, the mortality rate from physical assaults (per 100,000 population) was 7.4, well above the OECD average of 2.7 and at least seven times higher than most other high-income nations.<br><br>

            On the other hand, the U.S. performed well in cancer prevention and early detection. Along with Sweden, it had the highest breast cancer screening rates among women aged 50-69 and exceeded the OECD average for colorectal cancer screening rates. A separate study found that cancer mortality in the U.S. has decreased by 33% since 1991.<br><br>

            Reginald Williams II, who oversees the Commonwealth Fund's international program, stated, "This report underscores the importance of international comparisons." He added, "It presents an opportunity for the U.S. to learn from other countries and create a better healthcare system that delivers high-quality, affordable care to everyone."<br><br>

            Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association (APHA), noted, "It is once again confirmed that we spend more on healthcare but have the worst health outcomes, meaning we have low value for our healthcare dollar." He further stated, "The biggest lesson is that COVID-19 wasn't the silver bullet," and "Instead, it laid bare the holes in our healthcare system."<br><br>

            Benjamin outlined three directions for improving the U.S. healthcare system: ▶ expanding healthcare coverage, ▶ strengthening primary care and public health system innovation, and ▶ increasing social investments. He emphasized the need to provide healthcare coverage to all citizens, focus on disease prevention, and invest in social services that contribute to improving public health, thereby addressing the current structure of pouring resources into "treating illness."<br><br>

            Rising healthcare costs have been a longstanding concern for the U.S. healthcare sector. Structural factors such as the fragmented private insurance-based healthcare system, the profit-driven pharmaceutical and medical device industries, and excessive administrative costs have been identified as contributing to chronic healthcare cost increases.<br><br>

            In particular, the distorted health insurance system, which prevents patients from fully recognizing the cost burden of healthcare utilization, has been criticized for encouraging over-treatment and wasteful healthcare consumption. On the other hand, the healthcare gap and health disparities among low-income populations have seen little improvement.<br><br>

            The inefficiency of the U.S. healthcare system is often highlighted by the fact that national healthcare spending does not translate into improved public health. There are calls for actively managing unnecessary healthcare demand through measures such as expanding healthcare coverage, strengthening primary care, and enhancing preventive services.<br><br>

            Active government control over healthcare costs and reasonable price regulations also appear necessary. A reimbursement system should be established to provide cost-saving incentives for both consumers and providers and encourage evidence-based medical practices.<br><br>

            Simultaneously, efforts at the federal level should be made to improve healthcare coverage for socioeconomically vulnerable populations and address healthcare inequalities and health equity. Establishing a universal healthcare safety net that guarantees access to basic medical services regardless of an individual's economic capacity is urgently needed.<br><br>

            Rising healthcare costs are not a problem confined to the United States. Globally, healthcare expenditures are increasing rapidly, and the associated societal burden is growing. Particularly in South Korea, where the aging population is accelerating, the strain on national health insurance finances due to rising healthcare costs has reached a critical level.<br><br>

            The U.S. case starkly illustrates the limitations of a market-based healthcare model centered on private insurance. To build a sustainable healthcare system that conserves limited healthcare resources while providing quality medical services to all citizens, the government, healthcare sector, and civil society must pool their wisdom and work together.<br><br>

            Above all, a societal shift in perspective is needed, from viewing healthcare as a "money-making business" to recognizing it as a "public good." Healthcare professionals must remember that the fundamental spirit of medicine is to contribute to the realization of human dignity, rather than pursuing profit. An ethical consciousness that prioritizes the public interest and public nature of healthcare over profits is more essential than ever before.<br><br>

            The healthcare cost issue cannot be resolved solely through economic logic. It requires a reaffirmation of the state's responsibility for healthcare and citizens' rights, as well as the collective efforts of all societal members to realize the values of solidarity and sharing. We must all remain vigilant to ensure that the noble art of saving lives and alleviating suffering does not descend into a mere instrument of profit.<br><br>
