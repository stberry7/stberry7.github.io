As manufacturers strive to improve the performance, affordability, and sustainability of EVs, the search for alternative battery technologies has intensified. One promising candidate that has garnered significant attention is the sodium-ion battery. In this comprehensive article, we will delve into the potential of sodium-ion batteries to replace lithium-ion batteries in future EV models, including those from industry leader Tesla.</p> <p>Sodium-ion batteries have a research history dating back to the 1970s, running parallel to the development of lithium-ion batteries. However, their acceptance rate has been slower compared to lithium-ion due to limitations in the sodium storage capacity of positive electrode materials, primarily graphite, researched during that time. It's not that this battery technology is inferior to lithium; instead, it has grappled with the challenge of finding a suitable positive electrode material that can maximize its potential. But in recent years, everything has changed as we unravel the recent advancements in sodium-ion battery technology.</p> </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Advantages of Sodium-Ion Batteries</h2>
        <p>Sodium-ion batteries offer several compelling advantages that make them an attractive alternative to traditional lithium-ion batteries:</p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>1. Abundant and Low-Cost Sodium</h3>
            <p>One of the most significant advantages of sodium-ion batteries is the abundance and low cost of sodium compared to lithium. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element on Earth, constituting about 2.6% of the Earth's crust, surpassing the availability of lithium, which is the 33rd most abundant element. The contrast in their abundance becomes even more pronounced when considering the cost factor. In 2023, the price of lithium carbonate reached over $880,000 per ton, while sodium carbonate's current price is approximately $350 per ton. With this significant price difference and the chemical similarities between sodium and lithium, companies are increasingly exploring sodium as a viable and cost-effective alternative for EV batteries.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2. Environmentally Friendly Materials</h3>
            <p>Another advantage of the latest sodium-ion batteries is that they do not rely on scarce materials like cobalt and nickel, which typically constitute a fifth to a half of the components in lithium-ion batteries. These materials are neither inexpensive nor do they have stable prices, and Tesla is actively working towards eliminating them entirely due to various humanitarian and labor-related factors regarding extraction and production. While extracting sodium, whether from seawater or other sources, may not be entirely environmentally neutral, it is likely to be less polluting due to the abundant nature of sodium in the earth's crust.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3. Wide Operating Temperature Range</h3>
            <p>Sodium-ion batteries boast superior performance in both high and low-temperature conditions, making them an excellent solution in the field of energy storage. Their versatility is a result of effective operation over a wide temperature range from -40°C to 80°C. This makes sodium-ion batteries a preferred choice for applications that demand consistent and stable energy performance in diverse environmental conditions. With the ability to operate stably at low temperatures, sodium-ion batteries become particularly useful in renewable energy applications where temperatures may fluctuate suddenly or in environments with unstable conditions. Simultaneously, their efficient operation at high temperatures makes them an ideal choice for applications requiring high energy output while ensuring safety and stability during use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4. Competitive Performance</h3>
            <p>Sodium-ion batteries have an energy density exceeding 100 watt-hours per kilogram, enabling them to compete with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries but with a significant cost advantage. They also do not exhibit over-discharge characteristics, allowing them to discharge to zero volts. This makes them a potential replacement for traditional lead-acid batteries in large-scale energy storage applications. While sodium-ion batteries may not match the power of lithium-ion, their nature makes them suitable for creating EVs with a range from 170 miles to 190 miles, aligning with the expected characteristics of some upcoming models like Tesla's rumored "Model 2."</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Tesla and Sodium-Ion Batteries</h2>
        <p>Tesla, known for pushing boundaries in the EV industry, could be on the verge of another groundbreaking shift by exploring sodium-ion battery technology. Some inside sources suggest that Tesla has indeed researched sodium-ion batteries since 2017. However, there is secrecy surrounding the matter, and the technology has not been implemented up to the present time.</p>
        <p>Tesla seems to take sodium-ion batteries seriously, considering their potential game-changing factors. The primary requirement for an EV battery technology is high energy density to achieve a good driving range. Unfortunately, sodium-ion batteries have not yet met this criterion, with an average energy density ranging from 90 to 150 watt-hours per kilogram, lower than the 200-250 watt-hours per kilogram of lithium-ion batteries. Despite the current low energy density hurdle, Tesla has not permanently excluded sodium-ion technology from its research strategy.</p>
        <p>It is speculated that Tesla might be actively seeking ways to overcome this drawback, especially considering the successful application of sodium-ion batteries by competitors like BYD and the progress made by longtime Tesla partner CATL with sodium-ion batteries. Moreover, Tesla doesn't need to worry too much about expanding a dedicated factory for sodium-ion in the future if it becomes a chosen option. In terms of production, most sodium-ion technologies today use a process similar to lithium-ion batteries, which is advantageous in terms of economies of scale and knowledge transfer from lithium. Equipping an existing lithium plant with additional sodium-ion technology might only incur an additional 10% capital cost.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Sodium-Ion Batteries and Tesla's Rumored "Model 2"</h3>
            <p>If choosing the best-fit model for sodium-ion battery technology, it is certain that Tesla will apply it to the EV Gen 3, also known as the $25,000 electric car. This is because the characteristics of this type of battery are suitable for a more affordable vehicle rather than expensive high-end models. The battery constitutes at least 40% of the overall cost of this model EV, making sodium-ion technology a cost-effective choice for the "Model 2," as it's also known by (which may not be the official name; we're still waiting on Tesla to make that announcement).</p>
            <p>Customers of the "Model 2" won't have to worry about the price surging to $40,000 or $50,000 like the Model 3 or Y, allowing Tesla to maintain its commitment to an affordable EV for the mass market. Maintaining the $25,000 price tag for the EV Gen 3 would not only demonstrate Tesla's commitment to affordability but also potentially make the "Model 2" eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, making it quite electrifying for customers (no pun intended) who could acquire this hatchback for $17,500. The unique feature of having a separate battery technology would add intrigue to the "Model 2."</p>

        <h2>Comparison with Other Battery Technologies</h2>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>BMW's 4695 vs. Tesla's 4680</h3>
            <p>In September 2022, BMW announced that it would adopt an entirely new large cylindrical battery, the 4695, for the new class model starting in 2025. This raises the question: how can BMW's 4695 battery technology compete with Tesla's 4680?</p>
            <p>It's known that EVE will be the primary supplier of the 4695 battery for BMW. The 4695 is also a type of cylindrical lithium-ion NMC battery, quite similar to the 4680 but with a height of 95 mm. In terms of energy density, the 4680 battery ranges from 272 to 296 watt-hours per kilogram, while the energy density of the 4695 battery, based on our findings, is around 280 to 300 watt-hours per kilogram. We also researched the capacity of these batteries, with the 4695 having a capacity of 31,000 mAh and the 4680 having a capacity of 26,000 mAh.</p>
            <p>The difference in capacity is slightly significant, indicating that the BMW battery has the capability to store and deliver more energy. The higher energy density of the 4695 battery provides a longer range for electric vehicles. For example, a Tesla Model 3 with a 4680 battery can go up to 400 miles, while a 4695 battery can go up to 420 miles. This is an advantage that we highly appreciate about this type of battery; it can greatly improve the limitations of short-range electric vehicles.</p>
            <p>However, the 4695 battery also has higher electrical resistance than the 4680 battery. Higher electrical resistance means the battery will lose more energy during charging, which could reduce the charging efficiency of the battery as it requires more energy to reach a full charge. On the other hand, the 4680 Tesla battery has an all-pole tab structure, so it only takes 20 minutes to charge to reach 60% capacity. As recently announced, the Cybertruck uses an 800-volt voltage range for the 4680 battery pack, so the charging speed will be shortened to about 15 minutes.</p>
            <p>Another limitation of the 4695 battery is its weight. It is likely to be heavier within the same unit, at 445g per cell compared to the 355g of the 4680. When considering the application of these batteries in electric vehicles, it poses challenges in terms of the vehicle's weight and its impact on performance. As mentioned earlier, a 10% reduction in vehicle weight with CTC technology means the vehicle can operate longer while consuming the same amount of electric power.</p>
            <p>In terms of manufacturing costs, producing the 4680 battery could cost as low as $100 per kilowatt-hour, while manufacturing the 4695 battery might go up to $150 per kilowatt-hour due to its larger size requiring more materials and a more complex shaping process.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>StoreDot's XFC Battery</h3>
            <p>In addition to focusing on the large-scale production of the 4680, Tesla is also exploring a battery technology that addresses a key aspect the company has always aimed for: fast charging capability. The XFC (Extreme Fast Charging) battery, nicknamed "100in5," is what the manufacturer StoreDot is currently testing.</p>
            <p>The 100in5 battery is a lithium-ion pouch-type battery that utilizes StoreDot's high-density silicon anode technology with a 308 capacity. In the XFC battery, the silicon material of the positive electrode is nanostructured, increasing the surface area in contact with the electrolyte and thereby accelerating the transfer of lithium ions. It has the capability to store more energy, 10 times higher than traditional graphite positive electrode materials, allowing for faster charging without reducing battery capacity.</p>
            <p>In early November, we received information that StoreDot conducted an experiment involving multiple consecutive fast-charging cycles and compared them with slow-charging scenarios. Specifically, the company carried out 1,000 consecutive fast-charging XFC tests, including sessions where the charging state increased from 10% to 80% in just 10 minutes, as well as charging the state of charge (SOC) from 0% to 100% using extreme fast charging. After the conducted experiments, StoreDot achieved an impressive result: the XFC cells did not experience degradation compared to cells charged slowly from 0% to 100% SOC.</p>
            <p>This provides reassurance for those seeking a battery pack that can endure up to 1.5 million miles without encountering significant issues. StoreDot claims to provide a range of 100 miles with a full charge within 5 minutes, as promised by the company by the year 2024. If this claim holds true, the XFC battery will usher in a new era for electric vehicles from any manufacturer in the market.</p>
            <p>However, we acknowledge a limitation of StoreDot's XFC battery regarding the use of silicon as the positive electrode, which could potentially result in a higher cost compared to the traditional graphite positive electrode. From our research, the price of silicon is around $4,250 per ton, while graphite is cheaper at around $3,200 per ton. Fortunately, StoreDot estimates that the production cost could be significantly reduced, saving thousands of dollars by reducing the size of the battery pack, for example, from 80 kWh to 50 kWh, saving 200 kg. Because it is a pouch type, it is sure to be lighter than the cylindrical ones.</p>
