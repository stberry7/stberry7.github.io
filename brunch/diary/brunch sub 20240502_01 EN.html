    <title>Operation to Revive Grass - Diary Written with AI Claude | Recovering Grass Damaged by Snowplow</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In this diary written with the AI Claude, I documented my efforts to revive the grass that was damaged by a snowplow during the winter. Despite sowing grass seeds, they failed to germinate, so I explored a solution involving watering them like a potted plant. The diary captures the process of identifying the issue and challenging myself to bring the grass back to life, with anticipation for small changes and new sprouts.">

        <h2>Thursday, May 02, 2024, Saving the Grass</h2>
        <p>Written by Claude 3.0 Opus</p>
        
        <img src="../../image/brunch/20240502_grass.jpg" alt="Photo of damaged grass in the yard" width="100%">
        
        <p>Although spring has arrived after winter, the condition of the grass in front of our house wasn't good. During the past winter, while clearing snow, the front part of the snowplow accidentally passed over a significant portion of the grass, causing damage. Naturally, as spring arrived, other grasses began to grow anew, but the damaged area remained bare with exposed soil.</p>

        <p>About a month ago, feeling that I couldn't leave it as is, I bought grass seeds and sowed them. I spread them densely over a fairly large area, expecting the seeds to sprout and the grass to grow soon. However, even after a month since sowing the seeds, there was no noticeable change. The seeds I had sown around the same time in other areas had already sprouted and grown to some extent.</p>

        <p>Puzzled, I investigated the reason why the grass wasn't growing and realized it was a water supply issue. The soil where the seeds were sown had become tightly compacted, preventing proper water absorption. So, even when watered, the soil would quickly dry out, creating an unsuitable environment for the seeds to germinate and take root.</p>

        <p>To solve this problem, I decided to try the method of watering a potted plant. I obtained a large pot, placed it over the damaged grass area, and punctured small holes in the bottom with an awl. Then, I filled the pot with water. If all went as intended, the water from the pot would gradually seep into the soil, providing sufficient moisture for the seeds to grow.</p>

        <p>Although somewhat doubtful whether this approach would work, I felt I had to give it a try. At the very least, it would be better than doing nothing. While uncertain about how long it would take or whether I would see proper results, I decided to fill the pot with water daily and observe.</p>

        <p>On the one hand, I felt a sense of anticipation. What if, a few days later, a small sprout peeked out? Might that small change make me feel rewarded for my efforts? Even if it didn't work out, at least I could say that I tried my best.</p>

        <p>Looking back, the grass revival operation may seem trivial, but there's something enjoyable about attempting and waiting during this time. I find myself looking forward to the daily, gradual changes.</p>
