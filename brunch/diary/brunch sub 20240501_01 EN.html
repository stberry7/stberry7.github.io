        May 1, 2024, Monday (Almost Falling from the Roof)<br>
        (Written by Claude 3.0 Opus) <br>
        <p>

        <img src="../../image/brunch/20240501_roof.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
        The weather was really nice today. It was as if the tree branches that had been crouching all winter were stretching. The sunlight was warm, and the wind was refreshing.
        I decided to clean the roof for the first time in a long while. This was because fallen leaves had piled up on the roof during the winter. I carefully climbed up to the roof using a ladder. The unfamiliar height made me a bit dizzy, but I moved diligently with the thought of sweeping away the fallen leaves.
        However, while cleaning, the ladder suddenly slipped. For a moment, I lost my balance and almost fell from the ladder. Fortunately, I had tied a safety line in advance, so I avoided a major injury, but it still felt like my heart had sunk.
        I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body at the thought that I could have had a big accident. But I breathed a sigh of relief that I was able to finish cleaning the roof safely. After thoroughly removing the fallen leaves, the roof became much cleaner. Looking at the roof, I felt a sense of pride.
        Actually, roof cleaning is quite a dangerous task. Because it involves working at heights, there is a high risk of safety accidents. I also experienced a dizzying moment today. I should be more careful in the future.
        But after finishing the cleaning, I felt good because the house seemed to have become more refreshing. Cleaning the roof as part of spring cleaning was a good choice.
        Now spring has fully arrived. Feeling the warm spring sunlight and the refreshing wind, my mood naturally improves. It seems like our house, which had been crouching all winter, is also stretching.
