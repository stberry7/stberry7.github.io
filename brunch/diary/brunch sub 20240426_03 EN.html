    April 26, 2024, Friday (Nostalgic Fish-Shaped Bread)<br>
    (Written by Claude 3.0 Opus) <br>

    While watching TV, I suddenly felt like making fish-shaped bread (bungeoppang).
    <img src="../../image/brunch/20240426 fish.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
    After watching a broadcast program about a fish-shaped bread vendor making 15 million won in sales per day, I started imagining what it would be like to sell fish-shaped bread in the United States.
    Could introducing Korean street food culture to the United States attract the interest of locals? Especially if it's a food like fish-shaped bread, with a cute shape and sweet taste, it might be popular. If photos were posted on social media, it could spread quickly through word of mouth.
    While I was imagining this and that, I brought it up to my wife. But my wife immediately rejected my idea. She said that the United States is not a suitable environment for selling fish-shaped bread. Above all, the street food culture itself is not active, and there are not many people on the streets, so it would be difficult to do business.
    Listening to my wife's words, I realized she had a point. I thought it would not be easy to sell fish-shaped bread to passersby on crowded streets like in Korea. Moreover, it seemed that it would not be easy to make and sell street food in the United States, where hygiene regulations are strict.
    However, I didn't want to easily give up on an idea that I had in mind. Even if it's difficult to start a full-fledged business as my wife said, what about trying it on a small scale? I thought it would be okay to start by making fish-shaped bread at home.
    So I started searching for a fish-shaped bread machine on the internet. I found a small-sized machine on Amazon, and the price was around 35 dollars. It wasn't something I needed right away, but I put it in my shopping cart and am considering purchasing it.
    What if I bought a fish-shaped bread machine and made fish-shaped bread at home? It would be good as a snack, and I could also serve it as a special menu when inviting friends over. Furthermore, I thought it would be a fun experience to try selling the fish-shaped bread I made.
    Of course, turning this imagination into reality is never easy. From buying the fish-shaped bread machine to preparing the ingredients and mastering the skill of making delicious fish-shaped bread, the time and effort that need to be invested are not trivial. I need to reflect on whether I have that much passion.
    Moreover, I cannot ignore my wife's opposition. I think a process of listening to my spouse's opinion and discussing it together is necessary. If there are parts of my idea that my wife can sympathize with, she might support me, and we could find solutions to the practical difficulties together.
    Although it is only at the idea level now, if I prepare little by little, maybe I can realize it someday, even on a small scale? I think there will be joy in fulfilling my own small dreams one by one.
    I believe this process itself will make me feel small happiness. Breaking away from the repetition of daily life and taking on new challenges, wouldn't that be the vitality of life?
    Like the fish-shaped bread machine in my shopping cart, I hope my small dream can gradually become a reality. Although my wife initially showed a skeptical reaction, she might change her mind after seeing my passion. It would also be fun for us as a couple to create a new hobby together.
    In times like these, it may be unreasonable to aim for a big hit with a fish-shaped bread business, but providing people with a taste of nostalgia and feeling small happiness in it. I think that in itself is a meaningful thing.
    Of course, these thoughts may end up as a momentary imagination. But while imagining, my heart flutters. When I am tired of everyday life, I think it would be a good change of mood to spread the wings of imagination like this.
