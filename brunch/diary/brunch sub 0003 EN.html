    Tuesday, April 23, 2024<br>
    (Written by Claude 3.0 Opus) <br>
    <p>Today was a day with a distinct spring atmosphere. As soon as I opened my eyes early in the morning, warm sunlight poured in through the window. The body and mind that had been curled up all winter gently raised their heads at the energy of spring.
    With an excited heart, I ventured out to the garden in front of the house. As I approached under the plum tree and looked closely, I noticed that flower buds had already started to emerge. Each tiny, green-colored bud was full of vibrant energy.
    <img src="../../image/brunch/babyflower.jpg" alt="Baby Flower" width="100%">
    I took out my camera and pointed the lens at the flower buds perched on the plum tree branches. Zooming in and getting closer, the delicate texture of the flower buds became even clearer. The gently swollen petals were fluttering in the spring breeze. It was as if the mystery of the universe was condensed in this small bud.
    I press the shutter to capture this amazing moment in a photo. Not wanting to miss this moment, I keep pressing the shutter toward the flower buds. Standing under the plum tree and gazing at the flower buds, my heart naturally becomes peaceful. 
    Looking at the photos again, the appearance of the flower buds is captured as it is. The delicately expressed texture of the flower buds, as if viewed under a microscope, is so beautiful. Thanks to the smartphone camera technology that is advancing day by day, I am now able to take such wonderful photos. Suddenly, the blurry photos I took with a film camera in my elementary school days come to mind. I feel a sense of the changing times.
    I slowly strolled through the garden, leaving the plum tree. In the meantime, a stray cat crept up over the fence and sat on the railing. As if enjoying the spring energy, it stretched and slowly started wagging its tail. I, too, smiled softly, feeling good. It seems that all the creatures that have endured the long winter are enjoying spring.
    Every time I feel spring coming, I get excited and moved. I want to pat myself on the back for straightening my hunched shoulders and overcoming the long winter. I harbor the hope that the rest of my life can also bloom hopefully like flower buds. As I get older, the excitement I feel each spring seems to diminish a bit. But the more I try to savor and enjoy spring.
    Lost in the flower buds, I wandered for a while, and suddenly I came to my senses and noticed that the sun was already high in the sky. It's time to gradually return to daily life. I bid farewell to the plum tree and move my steps into the house.
    To not forget the emotions of this spring day, I post the flower bud photos on SNS. Just looking at the image of the flower buds that lift and drop my heart brings a sense of peace. 
    Seeing the flower buds poking their heads through the frozen ground of the past season, I am once again amazed by the wonder of nature. 
    Spring has arrived again this year without fail. Starting with the plum tree flower buds, the whole world will now be dyed in light green. I feel excited, waiting for the cherry blossom trees lining the streets to be in full bloom. </p>
