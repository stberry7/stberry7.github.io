            <h2>Friday, April 26, 2024 (Don't Trees Have a Natural Beauty Too?)</h2>
            <p>(Written by Claude 3.0 Opus)</p>
            <p>
                One morning, I discovered leaves that seemed to herald the arrival of spring. The sight of trees with sprouting buds and lush leaves looked fresh and vibrant. Liking the scene, I took a photo and sent it to my wife.
                <img src="../../image/brunch/20240426 tree.jpg" alt="Tree" width="100%">
                However, my wife's reaction was different from what I expected. She asked when I was going to prune the trees. In her eyes, the untrimmed branches probably looked messy. At that moment, I realized that our perspectives on trees were different.
                I don't know much about pruning. We have several trees at home, and they may look a bit untidy without pruning. But I don't feel that way. Trees in their natural state seem even more beautiful to me.
                Branches that have freely spread out instead of being cut seem more attractive. On the other hand, my wife seems to think that pruned trees look neater and more beautiful.
                If we prune the trees, they will look much tidier. Removing unnecessary branches and shaping them will allow the trees to grow more abundantly and in a balanced way. But at the same time, the individuality and freedom of the trees will be lost.
                Conversely, if we don't prune, the trees can grow in their own way. They can freely spread out, absorbing nutrients from the ground without anyone's interference. However, overgrown branches may hinder the tree's growth.
                Thus, pruning has its pros and cons. The appropriate method should be chosen depending on the situation and the type of tree. Neither unconditional pruning nor complete neglect is desirable. It is important to strike a balance for the health and beauty of the trees.
                My wife and I had different thoughts even when looking at the same trees. While my wife thought pruning was necessary, I didn't think it was needed. Now that we know our perspectives differ, what we need is communication.
                We should share our thoughts about the trees and find a compromise. While listening to my wife's opinion and understanding the need for pruning, I should also convey my thoughts and form a consensus on the natural beauty of trees.
                Through this incident, I should adopt an attitude of understanding and respecting each other's perspectives, not only regarding trees but also in various aspects of our lives. Although a couple should be of one heart and mind, they cannot be the same in every way. Recognizing and accepting differences will make our relationship even stronger.
                The difference in attitude toward trees may be a small scene in our daily life. But through it, we learn to understand and respect each other. I want us to continue communicating with an open attitude whenever we face differences, big or small, and grow together.
                We haven't decided yet whether to prune or not. For now, we should focus on acknowledging our differences in stance. I believe that after sufficient conversation, we can find our own way as a couple. Even if our opinions differ, our hearts will always be together.
                I hope our love will bloom anew each year like the leaves heralding spring. As we watch the leaves flourish and the branches spread, I hope we become a more mature couple. I wish for us to endure the pruning of time and stand tall as a grand tree, as our couple's future.
