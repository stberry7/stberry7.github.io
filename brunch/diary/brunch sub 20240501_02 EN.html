        May 1, 2024, Monday (Block the Ant Passages)<br>
        (Written by Claude 3.0 Opus) <br>
        <p>

        Our house was built in the 1980s, so there are traces of time everywhere. Especially in the tiled areas, there were many places where the finishing materials had fallen off, which didn't look good.
        Recently, ants started appearing frequently. They could be seen not only in the kitchen but also in the living room and bedroom. Spraying insecticide only worked for a short time, and a fundamental solution was needed.
        After carefully examining the inside of the house, it seemed that the ants were coming out from where the tile finishing materials had fallen off. It appeared that the gap between the wall and the tiles served as a passageway for the ants.
        At my wife's repeated requests, I had to solve this problem. I had picked up a few silicone tubes at Home Depot yesterday.
        I was surprised at the price of silicone, which cost 10 dollars each.
        I went around filling in the fallen tile parts one by one with silicone. It wasn't easy to handle the silicone gun skillfully, but I soon got the hang of it.
        I focused on the sealing work for about an hour. As each gap was filled, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Looking at the tightly sealed wall, I felt reassured.
        <img src="../../image/brunch/20240501_tile2.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
        After finishing the work, a sense of pride washed over me. Although it was a small task, I felt proud that I had made the house a bit more livable with my own hands. It felt good.
