    Monday, April 22, 2024 (Samsung Washing Machine) <br>
    (Written by Claude 3.0 Opus) <br>
    <p>
    
    As laundry piled up like a mountain over the weekend, my wife and I finally decided to buy a new washing machine on Sunday morning. Usually, we would've left it to Sunday, but this day we got up early and headed to Costco.
    After arriving at Costco, we closely examined the displayed washing machines. Not only the price but also the performance and design were carefully checked. Then, a Samsung washing machine caught our eye.
    "Honey, what do you think about this one? It seems to have a large capacity and good energy efficiency. Plus, the price is $300~"
    <img src="../../image/brunch/washer.jpg" alt="Washing Machine" width="100%">
    "Oh, it looks great. We've found the perfect one!"
    The washing machine was quite large, so we ended up getting help from an employee to load it onto the cart. After checkout, we arrived at the parking lot, and my wife said,
    "But honey, can the two of us move this? It looks heavy..."
    "Well, it'll be tough, but we have to do it somehow. We did well in the past. We can do it!"
    After struggling for a while to load it into the car, we went straight home. But the real problem was after arriving home. Moving the heavy washing machine to the house and putting it in place was no easy task.
    "Honey, this is too hard... Should we just call an installer?"
    "No, we have to do it ourselves. I don't want to pay for it. Let's just put in a little more effort!"
    Finally, after wrestling with it for over 2 hours, we were able to put the washing machine in place. Although cold sweat was running down my back, I felt a sense of accomplishment that we had done it.
    Next, we connected the water supply and drainage hoses and turned on the power. Everything seemed to be going smoothly. But when I opened the lid and tried to put in the laundry, something felt strange. Even after putting in the detergent and starting it, the washing machine wouldn't run.
    "What should we do? Could it be that we installed it wrong?"
    "No way, we definitely connected it properly... Should we check the manual one more time?"
    We struggled with the manual for a while, trying this and that, but the washing machine still wouldn't run after an hour.
    "Honey, at this rate, I won't be able to go to work tomorrow. Should we just call the service center?"
    "Ugh... They probably won't answer at this late hour. Hey, let's search online. There must be an answer."
    We thoroughly searched message boards and blogs on our smartphones. Then by chance, we found a post by someone who had the exact same symptoms as us. Thanks to that, we were able to find a clue to solve the washing machine problem.
    The drain hose connection was wrong. After removing the hose and plugging it in again to connect it properly, the washing machine soon started working normally. It was already close to 10 pm by the time we were finally able to do laundry.
    "Phew, that was really hard... But we did it, right? Amazing!"
    "Yeah. When the two of us combine our strength, there's nothing we can't do. As expected, our combo is the best."
    The washing machine installation operation with many twists and turns ended like that.. </p>
