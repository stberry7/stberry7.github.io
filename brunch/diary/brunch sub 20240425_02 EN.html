            <h2>Wednesday, April 24, 2024 (Deserted Golf Net)</h2>
            <p>(Written by Claude 3.0 Opus)</p>
            <p>
                Today, I stood in front of the golf net as always. Its deserted appearance seemed to represent my heart.
                <img src="../../image/brunch/golfnet2.jpeg" alt="Golf Net" width="100%">
                It is an undeniable fact that I have been neglecting golf practice since last year. It's not that I have completely given up golf. I have been consistently participating in league matches. It's just that my skills have been improving slowly due to lack of practice.
                Looking back two years ago, it seems like I was really crazy about golf. I used to go straight to the driving range after work, and on weekends, I would spend all day from morning to night on the green. I remember frequently going over the net because I couldn't hit the golf ball properly. When the ball disappeared into the dense forest, I had to wander around for a while. There were many trees, so there was no risk of people getting hurt, but it was true that I had a headache looking for the ball.
                One day, while I was absorbed in golf like that, I found myself unable to hold the golf club. As I got caught up in daily life and fatigue accumulated, my practice naturally decreased. As a result, my league match performance was not good, and I lost confidence. Still, it was fortunate that I hadn't completely neglected golf.
                Recently, I feel my passion for golf reviving. It's an encouraging change. When I took out the golf clubs that had been hibernating for a long time, I missed the heavy feel. Thanks to keeping the equipment well-maintained, there was no rust or dust. On the outside, I still looked like someone who was serious about golf.
                This year, I plan to focus more on improving my golf skills. The first goal is to increase my distance by about 10 yards. For a stable swing, I need to build a solid foundation. But before that, I need to reflect on whether I am a person who knows how to enjoy golf. I wonder if I have lost the true taste of golf while only chasing after technique.
                My wife supports me dedicating myself to golf. She encourages me, saying it's good for health and stress relief. Although there are times when I neglect practice due to busy daily life, thanks to my wife's consideration, I was able to enjoy golf without burden. I feel grateful to my wife.
                This weekend, I decided to go to the driving range for the first time in a while. I need to coordinate the schedule with my wife first and check for any lacking equipment. I think I need to prepare my mind as well. It would be good to return to the basics of golf and review course manners. Above all, I should approach golf with an enjoying mindset.
                Before going to the driving range, I decided to practice swinging near the golf net. It felt awkward to hold the golf club after a long time. Rather than pushing with force like before, the point was to swing softly. It felt unfamiliar to see the ball hitting the net and deflecting to the side. It seemed like I needed constant practice.
                After practicing for a while, I felt like I had regained the charm of golf. Just watching the ball fly through the air made my head feel clear. I could realize once again why I was mesmerized by golf. Perhaps golf is an exercise that is like a miniature of life. You can reap the fruits of your efforts, and sometimes you may go in unexpected directions.
                As I practiced hard, my confidence in golf gradually rose. I had a hopeful feeling that this year I could increase my distance by more than 10 yards. Rather than being greedy, it will be important to steadily build up my skills. The key will be not losing the mindset of enjoyment.
                I want to relieve stress and take care of my health through the two-in-one effect of enjoying golf. It will be a good way to maintain life balance even in a busy daily life. In the future, I hope to gain another vitality through golf.
                Imagining a golf course with trees lush with green makes me excited already. I look forward to the moment of making a great shot with nature as my companion. I also miss the leisure of enjoying a round with friends and having a beer at the 19th hole. This year, I want to savor a more enriched life through golf.
                Golf is definitely a precious hobby for me. I should invest more time and pour my heart into what I like. Sometimes, I may have to spend a long time looking for a ball that disappears into the forest. But isn't that also a part of golf and fun? If I have patience and enjoy it leisurely, I will find myself mastering golf before I know it.
                I finished today's practice and organized the golf net. The fresh greenery and the thrilling feel of hitting the ball made me forget the fatigue of the day. As I put the golf club back in its place, I looked forward to the round that would take place soon. The thought of meeting golf friends after a long time and relieving our friendship made me feel good. With a lively heart, I envision a future with golf.
