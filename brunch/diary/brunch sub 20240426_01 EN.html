            <h2>Thursday, April 25, 2024 (Wife Drinks Wine)</h2>
            <p>(Written by Claude 3.0 Opus)</p>
            <p>
                Throughout our long married life, I had never seen my wife drink alcohol.
                <img src="../../image/brunch/wine1.png" alt="Wine" width="100%">
                I like to drink, but my wife seemed to be distant from alcohol. Although we had different preferences for alcohol, we have been respecting each other.
                But today, my wife picked up a glass of wine. After drinking one glass, she drank another, saying it was delicious. I was surprised to see this for the first time and also felt happy. I had the expectation that now I could have a drink with my wife.
                At the same time, I was also a bit worried. I was worried that my wife might start enjoying alcohol, that she might come to like alcohol as much as I do. Alcohol is like a good friend to those who enjoy it, but it can also be a poison if it's excessive. I knew that well.
                Still, I soon put those thoughts aside. My wife is a person with self-control. Having a drink or two won't make her a slave to alcohol. I thought she just had a little to change her mood.
                Actually, in the early days of our marriage, I had wanted to have a drink with my wife. At that time, I gave up because my wife didn't enjoy alcohol, but now it seemed like that opportunity had come, so I was happy. I thought we could often clink glasses and have conversations in the future.
                But on the other hand, I was also worried that alcohol might distance us. Because alcohol can be harmful to human relationships if you get too close to it. Still, we love and trust each other. I believed alcohol would never drive us apart.
                I like drinking, but I have respected my wife's preferences. Now that my wife also seems to enjoy alcohol occasionally, I'm glad. In the future, it would be nice if the two of us could moderately enjoy alcohol and build good memories together.
                However, we should both become adults who know how to control alcohol. Alcohol is a spice of life, not a staple food. It would be good if we both pay attention to enjoying it for a change of mood but not overdoing it.
                Alcohol has the power to change the life of the person who drinks it. Whether in a good direction or a bad direction. We need to maintain an appropriate distance from alcohol, taking advantage of its positive functions but being wary of its negative functions.
                Seeing my wife drink alcohol today, I suddenly feel the passage of time. The wife who was a young bride when we got married is now a respectable wife and mother. If there's one thing that doesn't change over time, it would be our love.
                I want to have drinks together often in the future and build good memories. Time to open up and talk about our innermost thoughts. Time to have a moment for just the two of us after a long time. If such times accumulate, we can develop into a deeper love.
                Discovering a new side of my wife today is meaningful for us as a couple. If we continue to pay attention to each other and make efforts to get to know one another, we can become an even stronger couple. Having a drink together may be a small thing, but through it, we can learn to understand and respect each other. In that sense, today seems to be a significant day.
