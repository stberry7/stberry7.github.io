I captured the scene of the grand Michigan Stadium, which can accommodate 100,000 people, and the emotions of a parent witnessing their child's graduation. I express my love and support for my child as they take their first steps into the world.">

        <h2>Saturday, May 04, 2024, My Eldest Child's College Graduation Day</h2>
        <p>Written by Claude 3.0 Opus</p>

        <img src="../../image/brunch/20240504_grad1.png" alt="Photo of the graduation ceremony at the Michigan Stadium" width="100%">

        <p>Today was the day of my eldest child's college graduation. My eldest is graduating from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. Our family left early in the morning, bustling with excitement to be a part of this momentous occasion.</p>

        <p>The University of Michigan campus was truly large and grand. The graduation ceremony was held at the Michigan Stadium. The stadium was massive, able to accommodate 100,000 people, and today it was nearly filled to its vast capacity. Seats were pre-assigned, and families waited in their designated spots for the ceremony to begin.</p>

        <p>Before entering the stadium, we decided to grab a quick lunch. We bought two hamburgers, a bottle of water, and a bottle of cola, which cost a whopping $28. It was an expensive purchase.</p>

        <style>
            .video-container {
                position: relative;
                width: 100%;
                padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */
            }

            .video-container video {
                position: absolute;
                top: 0;
                left: 0;
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
            }
        </style>

        <div class="video-container">
            <video id="myVideo" controls>
                <source src="../../image/brunch/20240504_grad3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                <p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
            </video>
        </div>

        <script>
            const video = document.getElementById('myVideo');

            const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
                entries.forEach((entry) => {
                    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                        video.play();
                    } else {
                        video.pause();
                    }
                });
            }, {
                threshold: 0.5 // Play the video when at least 50% is visible
            });

            observer.observe(video);
        </script>

        <p>Finally, the graduation ceremony began. It lasted more than three hours. There were moments of boredom, to be honest. The speakers' voices echoed inside the grand stadium, making it difficult to understand them properly.</p>

        <p>However, a slight commotion occurred midway through the ceremony. Around 70 pro-Palestinian protesters began chanting slogans against the recent Israel-Hamas war and waving Palestinian flags. They marched around the stadium with banners, but they were too far for me to make out the content.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, their protest did not significantly disrupt the graduation ceremony itself. Police officers were dispatched, but no arrests were made. Despite the protest incident, the graduation ceremony proceeded without major issues, concluding with the president's brief and emphatic remarks.</p>

        <p>I feel a great desire to congratulate my eldest child on their graduation. After completing their long college journey, they are now taking their first steps into the working world. While the path ahead may not be smooth, I hope they learn to pick themselves up when they fall. As a parent, all I can offer is love and support, but that is enough.</p>

        <p>After the long graduation ceremony, we returned home. The hectic day left me utterly drained. I had a late lunch and collapsed on the couch, unintentionally falling asleep. And so, the day comes to an end.</p>
