            <h2>Wednesday, April 24, 2024 (Let's See Inside a Golf Ball LOL)</h2>
            <p>(Written by Claude 3.0 Opus)</p>
            <p>
                Seeing a photo of a cut golf ball made me feel curious.
                <img src="../../image/brunch/golfballinside2.*" alt="Inside a Golf Ball" width="100%">
                I thought I knew quite a bit about golf balls since I love golf, but actually seeing the inside like this seemed to reveal a new aspect. I knew that the structures of 2-piece, 3-piece, and 4-piece golf balls are each different, but this was the first time I compared them through cross-sections.
                The golf balls in the photo were like frog models dissected in biology class. Although all the balls look the same on the outside, the insides had different appearances. The 2-piece ball was divided into two simple layers, while the 3-piece and 4-piece balls had more complex structures. The engineering sophistication was remarkable.
                Observing the inside of the golf balls reminded me of my criteria for selecting golf balls. Actually, I usually only purchase and use 2-piece golf balls. 3-piece and 4-piece balls are too expensive, so I don't readily reach for them. I thought 2-piece balls were sufficient for enjoyment, so there was no need to buy expensive balls.
                According to fellow golfers, 2-piece balls are good for distance, while 3-piece and 4-piece balls are easy to control direction. But when I hit a 2-piece ball, it doesn't go that far. Is it all the fault of the golf ball? Or is it my skill?
                My friends advise that I need to change my swing posture first. They say I need to increase the clubhead speed and focus strength at the moment of impact to increase distance. It means my ability is the problem rather than the type of golf ball. Looking back, I reflect on whether I have neglected proper practice using the excuse of golf balls.
                In the end, it seems the most important thing in golf is the golfer's skill. Suddenly using an expensive golf ball doesn't improve your skills. Rather, you need constant practice and fundamentals to properly utilize the performance of golf balls. In this context, it would be wise to choose golf balls according to your skill level.
                For beginners, it would be good to first learn the basics with 2-piece balls. After becoming somewhat proficient, upgrading to 3-piece or 4-piece balls is also a method. There is no guarantee that skills will improve just by using high-priced golf balls. The golfer's ability is as important as the golf ball.
                Seeing the photo of the cut golf ball makes me think I should practice harder. Like doing science experiments in my student days, I need to objectively examine my golf skills. I should analyze everything from posture to swing in detail and find problem areas. I think it will be important to supplement lacking parts with customized training.
