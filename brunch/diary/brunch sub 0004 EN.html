    Today, I went for a morning walk with Mary as usual. Although the course was now familiar and there was nothing special to see, my eyes were somehow drawn to the lawn, as they always were. It was because I had recently spotted a small snake on that lawn from time to time.
    The first time I discovered that snake, I was startled. But when I looked closely, it was a very small and cute little thing. It didn't seem to be a venomous snake, but I thought I should be careful since it was still a snake.
    But strangely, our Mary wasn't scared at all when she saw that snake. Rather, she approached the snake with curious eyes and greeted it, wagging her tail. The snake also raised its head when it saw Mary. It was as if there was a strange connection between the two.
    Since then, Mary and I have encountered the snake every day as we passed by that lawn. Before we knew it, that little snake had become a part of our daily life. For Mary, it seemed like a playmate, and for me, it was an interesting spectacle.
    A week passed like that. The snake was unchangingly there on the lawn, and Mary still greeted it, wagging her tail. One day, I suddenly became curious. Do snakes have emotions too? Would it recognize us? But that would be something I could never know.
    Today, I went to the lawn with Mary as well. But the snake was nowhere to be seen. Mary sniffed around, searching for the snake, but she couldn't find it in the end.

    We could come again tomorrow. Surely it couldn't have gone somewhere. Even though it was just an ordinary part of the day, the fact that a small snake had disappeared somehow weighed on my mind.
    The next day and the day after that, the snake still didn't appear. Seeing Mary's disappointed eyes, I felt strangely let down without knowing it myself. I thought it was silly to be so disappointed over just one snake, but it felt like a piece of the familiar daily life had disappeared, and I couldn't get used to it.
    Still, the world flowed on without stopping. Mary and I still went for walks every day and passed by the same lawn. The snake was no longer seen, but perhaps that is the law of nature. Where there are encounters, there are also partings.
    But sometimes, when Mary and I make eye contact, we think of that little snake. Those moments we shared together, even if very brief. The small being that passed through our lives may only reveal its presence after it has left. And another day fades like that.</p>
