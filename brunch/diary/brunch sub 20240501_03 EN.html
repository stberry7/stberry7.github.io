        <title>Memories of the Rusty Ford Escape - Diary Written with AI Claude | Attachment to a Family Car for Over 10 Years</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Our family's first car, the Ford Escape, has started to rust. In this diary, I wrote about the process of inspecting the rust problem with the AI Claude and exploring solutions. Recalling the attachment and memories with the old vehicle, I take on the challenge of rust removal and corrosion prevention. Despite financial constraints, I document my efforts to keep our cherished car for a bit longer.">

            <h2>Monday, May 01, 2024, Our Family's First Car That Has Been with Us for Over 10 Years</h2>
            <p>Written by Claude 3.0 Opus</p>
    
            <img src="../../image/brunch/20240501_ford.jpg" alt="Photo of Rusty Ford Escape" width="100%">
            
            <p>Today, I closely inspected the Ford Escape. I realized the rust problem has become severe. When I touched the rusted areas with my hand, flakes were falling off. If left unattended, holes might form.</p>
    
            <p>Initially, when I first noticed it, it seemed like just a small rust spot, and I didn't perceive the severity. However, as time passed, the rust spread rapidly. It has become an urgent situation that can no longer be neglected.</p>
    
            <p>I feel heavy-hearted. I didn't expect the rust to progress to this extent. However, when I look at other Ford Escapes, I see that rust has also fallen off in the same areas, so there may have been a design flaw with the vehicle, which I try to rationalize.</p>
    
            <p>The Ford Escape was our first car when we initially arrived in the United States. It accompanied us on trips to New York, Boston, Florida, and as far south as Key West. Precious memories from those times come flooding back. I miss the excitement of traveling across America back then.</p>
    
            <p>Repairing the car won't be cheap. It might require rust removal work, followed by fender replacement. I'll need professional help, but with a tight budget these days, it's daunting to afford the repair costs.</p>
    
            <p>For a while, our household is expected to be tight due to the children's education expenses. We can't afford to replace the car immediately. However, I'm uneasy about driving a car with rust flaking off. Safety concerns due to rust are also worrisome.</p>
    
            <p>What should I do? My thoughts are complicated. I need to contemplate the best course of action. For now, it might be best to start with basic rust removal. If I remove the rust and apply corrosion prevention treatment, perhaps I can keep driving the car for a bit longer.</p>
    
            <p>I should thoroughly remove the rusted areas, buy putty from Home Depot, apply it to the damaged spots to fill in the holes, and then finish with a rust-preventive paint. Since I can't afford a fender replacement right away, I should focus on rust prevention. To reduce costs, I might also consider doing some of the work myself.</p>
    
            <p>I need to find effective methods for rust removal and corrosion prevention. Stopping further rust progression and maintaining the car's safety is the top priority. During this period of substantial educational expenses for the children, I couldn't help but neglect the car's maintenance.</p>
    
            <p>I'll gradually address the rust problem while continuing to drive this car for now. Once our financial situation improves, I can consider a new car at that time. It warms my heart to think that I'll be able to keep the Ford Escape, which has provided our family with so many cherished memories, a bit longer.</p>
