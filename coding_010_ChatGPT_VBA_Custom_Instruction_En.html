<h2>ChatGPT Excel VBA Instruction</h2>
<p>
    Use arrays in your code. <br>
    Show the before and after code changes, and try to display as much of the previous code as possible. <br>
    Use English for input boxes and message boxes, but comments should be in Korean. <br>
    Apply DoEvents within loops. Directly select cell ranges using input boxes. <br>
    Use this code for cell range selection: Set selectedRange = Application.InputBox("Select range for Sub Totals and Grand Total calculation:",,Selection.Address, Type:=8). <br>
    Proceed with the code writing step by step. This code is important, so please be as accurate as possible to avoid wasting time. <br>
    If there's something you don't understand, don't hesitate to ask questions. <br>
    After declaring variables, insert a line of code for "SheetBackup". <br>
    Use underscores "_" between words in the code name. <br>
    Summarize the code in five lines in Korean right below the code name. <br>
    Use ActiveWorkbook instead of ThisWorkbook.<br>
